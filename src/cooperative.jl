Inputs
------
player_set : Vector
    Vector of the players of the coalition
utilities : AbstractDictionary or Function
    AbstractDictionary storing the utilities for every coalition.
    or Function to derive the utility by each coalition
optimizer : Any
    Optimizer function for the JuMP model used for computation purposes
mode : AbstractCalcMode
    Calculation mode: enumerative technique
verbose : Bool (optional, default true)
    When true, it shows a progress bar to describe the current execution status

Outputs
------
